# ML_Basics
Welcome to this repository! Here you'll find Python implementations and explanations of fundamental Machine Learning (ML) concepts, ideal for beginners and enthusiasts looking to strengthen their understanding of ML foundations.

This repository currently includes the following core ML concepts:

Gradient Descent
Learn how optimization works in ML by implementing the most popular algorithm for minimizing loss functions.

Neural Network (Feedforward NN)
A basic implementation of a simple feedforward neural network with backpropagation.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Introduction to CNNs for image data, including convolution layers, pooling, and activation functions.

Linear Classifier
Understand how to build a simple linear classifier (e.g., perceptron or logistic regression) and how it separates data in feature space.

One-Hot Encoding
A simple but essential preprocessing step to convert categorical labels into a numerical format that ML model can use.
