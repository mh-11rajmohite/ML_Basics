# ML_Basics
🚀 Welcome to the Machine Learning Playground! 🧠💻
This repository is your entry point into the fascinating world of Machine Learning (ML). 
Whether you're just getting started or brushing up on the basics, you'll find clear and 
simple Python implementations of core ML concepts that form the building blocks of modern AI.

🔍 What's Inside?

Each concept is explained with code and intuition, so you don’t just code it — you understand it.

📉 1. Gradient Descent
"The heart of optimization."
🔧 Learn how ML models learn! Implement the most widely used algorithm to minimize loss functions and update model parameters step by step.

🧠 2. Neural Network (Feedforward NN)
"A brain-inspired model for learning patterns."
🧬 Build a basic neural network from scratch — no frameworks, just math and NumPy. See how forward and backward propagation work under the hood.

🖼️ 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
"When pixels meet patterns."
🔍 Dive into image recognition with CNNs. Explore convolution layers, pooling, and ReLU activation with hands-on examples.

➕ 4. Linear Classifier
"Drawing lines between classes."
⚖️ Create a simple yet powerful classifier (like logistic regression or perceptron) to separate data in high-dimensional space.

🔢 5. One-Hot Encoding
"Making categories count."
📊 Learn how to convert categorical labels into machine-readable vectors — an essential preprocessing step for classification tasks.
